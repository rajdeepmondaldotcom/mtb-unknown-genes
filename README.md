# Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Unknown Genes Analysis

This project performs an analysis to find the top 5% of homologous proteins for the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* proteome.

## Overview

The analysis follows these steps:
1. Set up the environment with BLAST+ and Python libraries
2. Download the *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv proteome and Swiss-Prot database
3. Prepare and run the BLAST search
4. Filter and shortlist results to identify top homologs

## Requirements

- NCBI BLAST+
- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: pandas, biopython

## Usage

Follow the scripts in this repository to replicate the analysis.
